## Experiment 6: Single Phase Semi Controlled Converter R-L load (Asymmetrical and Symmetrical)

AIM: This experiment is aimed to study the operation of single phase semi controlled (Asymmetrical and Symmetrical) converter using R-L load by observing the output waveforms. The circuit is
implemented in simulation as well as hardware and the performance is studied.
