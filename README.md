## Introduction
This repo contains my attempt at the Power Electronics (EEE F342) lab component which invloves the usage of MATLAB Simulink.

## List of experiments
1. Experiment 1 : Introduction to Power electronics Lab simulation And Hardware setup
2. Experiment 2: Single Phase Uncontrolled (Diode) Rectifier
3. Experiment 3: Three Phase Uncontrolled (Diode) Rectifier
4. Experiment 4: Single and Three phase uncontrolled rectifier with Capacitor Filter
5. Experiment 5: Single Phase Fully Controlled Converter using R and R-L load
6. Experiment 6: Single Phase Semi Controlled Converter R-L load (Asymmetrical and Symmetrical)
7. Experiment 7: Three Phase Fully Controlled Converter
8. Experiment 8: DC to DC Converter
