## Experiment 9: Single Phase, Phase controlled Bi-directional AC to AC controller using TRIAC with R and R-L load

AIM: This experiment is aimed to study the operation of Single Phase, Phase controlled Bidirectional AC to
AC controller using TRIAC with R and R-L load by observing the output waveforms. The circuit is
implemented in simulation as well as hardware and the performance is studied.
