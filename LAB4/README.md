## Experiment 4: Single and Three phase uncontrolled rectifier with Capacitor Filter
AIM: This experiment is aimed to analyze the effect of capacitor filter or smoothing capacitor on rectified
output voltage for both single phase and three phase uncontrolled rectifiers. The circuit is
implemented in simulation as well as hardware and the performance is studied.
